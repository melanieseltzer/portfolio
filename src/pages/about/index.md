I'm an Aussie developer with 8 years industry experience. I moved to USA in 2010 and have been in Los Angeles ever since. I am currently doing Front End development at [Still Water](http://still-water.com) in Santa Monica, CA.

Some of my other loves include video games, hiking, traveling, and annoying my cat, *Callie* ðŸ‘‡
