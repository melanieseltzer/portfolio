I decided to create a simple interface to easily 'grab' your Gravatar (see what I did there? 😉) and see it displayed.

The user enters their email address in the form (which is made with the awesome <a href="https://github.com/jaredpalmer/formik" target="_blank">Formik</a>) and their address is validated, normalized (trimmed and lowercase), and hashed using md5.

The Gravatars are compiled using the hash from the address bar.
