I created a Node/Express API to generate quotes from the tv show *Friends*, because it's quite possibly one of the greatest shows on earth.

User has three endpoints to choose from:

`GET /quotes`

Returns an array of all quotes.

`GET /quotes/random`

Returns a single random quote.

`GET /quotes/{num}`

Returns an array of quotes (which are randomized) with length {num}.
