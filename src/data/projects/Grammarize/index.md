Have you ever needed to display some sort of count (e.g. how many new messages a user has) and been annoyed that if you have less than 2, the surrounding copy is off (e.g. "You have 1 new messages")?

Grammarize helps with that. Simply feed it a numerical input, and what you want the singular and plural text to say, and it will automatically switch between them as needed.
